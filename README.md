# Ticket-Booking-System
Ticket Booking System is a simple Java-based application that allows users to book tickets, view booked tickets, and exit the system. This project simulates a basic ticketing system for a railway or bus service, where passengers can reserve seats by providing their name, destination, and ticket price.
